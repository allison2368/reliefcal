# ReliefCal: Providing easy access to disaster relief resources

HackDavis submission for California GovOps Agency. Our goal is to create solutions to support data-driven, culturally and demographically sensitive fire recovery. The app is created with users in mind and can be easily used by residents of all ages. It quickly directs people to immediate and non-immediate fire disaster recovery.
